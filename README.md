🧩 Problem Statement

With the rapid global shift toward sustainable transportation, Electric Vehicles (EVs) are becoming increasingly popular. However, choosing the right EV remains a major challenge for consumers. The market is flooded with diverse models that differ in price, range, battery capacity, charging time, and regional availability — making it difficult for users to identify the best fit for their needs and lifestyle.

Traditional comparison platforms only provide static data and lack personalized insights or intelligent recommendations. They do not consider user-specific preferences such as daily commute distance, charging accessibility, or driving habits, nor do they offer meaningful explanations behind their suggestions.

To overcome these challenges, this project introduces the EV Recommendation Assistant — an AI-powered web application that leverages Machine Learning and Generative AI (GenAI) to provide personalized EV recommendations based on real-world data.

By integrating data from the Global EV Sales 2024 Dataset and Electric Vehicle Specifications Dataset, the system analyzes vehicle performance, market popularity, and user preferences to suggest the most suitable EVs.

Additionally, a GenAI-powered chatbot enhances user interaction by:

💬 Handling natural language queries (e.g., “Suggest me an EV under ₹25L with at least 300 km range”).

🧠 Providing human-like explanations for recommendations (“The Tata Nexon EV is ideal because it balances range, affordability, and fast charging support”).

🔍 Addressing user doubts and comparisons (“How does the MG ZS EV differ from the Hyundai Kona Electric?”).

This intelligent assistant combines data-driven insights with conversational reasoning, helping users make confident, informed, and sustainable EV purchase decisions.
